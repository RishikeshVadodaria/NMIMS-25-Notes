'll help you identify key technical gaps and provide some foundational research papers in the field of AI-powered data anonymization. 

Technical Gaps to Address in Your Research:

1. Contextual Understanding
- Challenge: Current systems struggle with context-dependent privacy requirements
- Research opportunity: Developing models that understand semantic relationships and privacy implications in context
- Gap: Limited ability to handle complex language nuances and domain-specific privacy requirements

2. Dynamic Privacy Requirements
- Challenge: Privacy requirements vary across industries and regions
- Research opportunity: Creating adaptive anonymization frameworks
- Gap: Existing solutions often use static rules and thresholds

1. Scalability vs. Accuracy
- Challenge: Maintaining performance with large-scale datasets
- Research opportunity: Optimizing anonymization algorithms for big data
- Gap: Current solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed

2. Re-identification Risk
- Challenge: Preventing data reconstruction through correlation attacks
- Research opportunity: Developing better risk assessment models
- Gap: Limited understanding of how multiple anonymized datasets could be combined for re-identification
