## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices for Writing Wiki-Style Documentation

To ensure clarity and usability, the following best practices are adopted while creating and maintaining the notes:

- **Know Your Audience:** Tailor your content, style, tone, and length based on the intended audience's needs.
- **Start with Structure:** Begin with an outline or template to organize your thoughts effectively.
- **Use Links:** Add [hyperlinks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) to provide context and additional details.
  - For placeholders, use `[[ ]]` to mark links for future addition.
- **Keep it Concise:** Replace large blocks of text with [bullet lists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#lists) where appropriate.
- **Organize with Headings:** Use [headings](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings) to improve navigation and help readers quickly find information.
- **Visualize Ideas:** Utilize [diagrams](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams) to convey relationships effectively. Tools like [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/) are preferred over static images for flexibility.
