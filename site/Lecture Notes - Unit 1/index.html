<ul>
<li><strong>What to do</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to map situations to actions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maximizing a numerical reward signal</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> is an autonomous, self-teaching system that essentially learns by trial and error. It performs actions with the aim of maximizing rewards, or in other words, it is learning by doing in order to achieve the best outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent
learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of
actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the
agent gets negative feedback or penalty</p>
<h3 id="key-characteristics">Key Characteristics</h3>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is inspired by how <strong>humans and animals</strong> learn through interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reward and Punishment</strong>: Encourages repeating actions that lead to rewards and avoiding punishments.</li>
<li><strong>Trial and Error</strong>: Similar to trying different methods until the correct one is found.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Over Time</strong>: Improvement occurs through continuous experience.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rewards Come from a Sequence of Actions</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The learner is <strong>not told</strong> which actions to take but must <strong>discover</strong> them through trial and error.</p>
</li>
<li>Actions affect not only the <strong>immediate reward</strong> but also <strong>future situations and rewards</strong>.</li>
<li>Works well in problems where a <strong>sequence of decisions</strong> is important.</li>
</ul>
<p>RL is an <strong>autonomous, self-teaching</strong> system that learns by <strong>trial and error</strong>.
The goal is to <strong>maximize rewards</strong> over time.</p>
<p><strong>Example Applications</strong>:
    - Chess
    - Maze solving
    - Industrial robot arms
    - Path planning
    - Sweeper robots</p>

<h2 id="advantages-of-reinforcement-learning">Advantages of Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>✅ No need for predefined instructions or human intervention. 
✅ Can adapt to <strong>both static and dynamic environments</strong>. 
✅ Solves a <strong>wide range of problems</strong> (decision-making, prediction, optimization). 
✅ Improves with <strong>experience</strong> and fine-tunes over time.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-reinforcement-learning">Disadvantages of Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>❌ Performance depends on the <strong>quality of the reward function</strong>. 
❌ <strong>Designing and tuning</strong> RL models can be <strong>complex</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]</p>
<h6 id="when-to-apply-reinforcement-learning">When to Apply Reinforcement Learning?</h6>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is most suitable when:
- The problem environment is <strong>complex and uncertain</strong>, making traditional programming methods ineffective.
- Feedback is <strong>sparse, delayed, and dependent</strong> on multiple decisions.
- Decision-making (actions) follows a <strong>feedback loop</strong>.</p>
<h6 id="why-is-reinforcement-learning-difficult">Why Is Reinforcement Learning Difficult?</h6>
<p>The toughest parts of Reinforcement Learning are:
- <strong>Mapping the Environment</strong>.
- <strong>Including All Possible Actions</strong>.</p>
<h6 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal-Oriented Learning</strong>: The agent learns by trying to achieve a goal.</li>
<li><strong>Learning from Consequences</strong>: The agent learns from the consequences of its actions.</li>
<li><strong>Active Research Area</strong>: RL is one of the most <strong>active</strong> fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI).</li>

<h3 id="trade-off-between-exploration-and-exploitation">Trade-off between Exploration and Exploitation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To obtain rewards, an RL agent must prefer actions that it has tried in the past and found effective (<strong>Exploit</strong>).</li>
<li>However, to discover such actions, it must try actions it has not selected before (<strong>Explore</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Neither exploration nor exploitation can be pursued exclusively without failing at the task.

<h2 id="fundamental-components-of-rl">Fundamental Components of RL</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy</strong>: Defines the agent’s behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Reward Function</strong>: Provides feedback on actions.</li>
<li><strong>Value Function</strong>: Evaluates future rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Model of the Environment</strong>: Simulates how the environment works.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="policy">Policy:</h5>
<p>A <strong>policy</strong> is a strategy or set of rules that defines the actions the agent should take in a given state.</p>
<ul>
<li>The policy can be deterministic (one action for a state) or stochastic (probabilistic actions for a state).</li>
<li>The <strong>goal</strong> is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the total expected reward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A robot navigating a maze may follow a policy that says, "Always turn left unless there's an obstacle, then turn right."</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="human-analogy">Human Analogy:</h6>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>policy</strong> is like a person's <strong>habit or plan of action</strong>, such as the decision to exercise every morning or take an umbrella when it's cloudy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="value-function">Value function:</h4>
<p>Roughly speaking, the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. 
- Rewards determine the <strong>immediate, intrinsic desirability</strong> of environmental states. 
- Values indicate the <strong>long-term desirability</strong> of states after considering the states likely to follow and the rewards available in those states. 
- <strong>Example</strong>: - A state might always yield a low immediate reward but still have a <strong>high value</strong> because it is followed by states that yield high rewards. </p>
<h4 id="human-analog">Human Analog</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rewards are somewhat like kepleasureur (if high) and ndpainai (if low). - Values correspond to a more rerefined and farsighted judgmenten of how pleased or displeased we are by the environment.nt.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="reward-function">Reward Function:</h5>
<p>The <strong>reward function</strong> provides feedback on the actions the agent takes, indicating whether an action was good or bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>It assigns a <strong>numeric value</strong> to the agent's actions, which the agent uses to evaluate the desirability of its actions in a given state.</li>
<li>The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a game, winning a round might give a reward of +10, while losing gives a reward of -1.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="human-analogy_1">Human Analogy:</h6>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>reward function</strong> is like the <strong>feedback</strong> a person gets from their actions, such as feeling <strong>happy</strong> after a good deed or <strong>guilty</strong> after a mistake.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="model-of-the-environment_1">Model of the Environment:</h5>
<p>The <strong>model of the environment</strong> simulates how the environment behaves, helping the agent predict the outcomes of actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>This model can be used for <strong>planning</strong> future actions by simulating potential outcomes.</li>
<li>A model-free approach directly learns from experience, while a model-based approach uses a model to predict actions' results before performing them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A self-driving car may use a model to simulate various driving scenarios and plan its route accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="human-analogy_2">Human Analogy:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>model of the environment</strong> is like a <strong>mental map</strong> that a person forms, which helps them predict the likely outcomes of their actions, such as deciding to avoid a route with heavy traffic.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="final-element-of-rl-systems-model-of-the-environment">Final Element of RL Systems: <strong>Model of the Environment</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The model <strong>mimics the behavior of the environment</strong>, allowing inferences to be made about how the environment will behave.</li>
<li>For example, given a state and action, the model might predict the resultant next state and next reward.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Models</strong> are used for <strong>planning</strong>, helping the agent decide on a course of action by considering future situations before they are experienced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods for solving RL problems that use models and planning are called <strong>model-based methods</strong>, while simpler trial-and-error learning methods are called <strong>model-free methods</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="types-of-reinforcement-learning">Types of Reinforcement Learning</h1>
<p>There are three main types of Reinforcement Learning (RL):
- <strong>Value-Based</strong>
- <strong>Policy-Based</strong>
- <strong>Model-Based</strong></p>
<p>Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="value-based-reinforcement-learning">Value-Based Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this approach, the agent learns to estimate the value of each state or action based on the rewards it receives.</li>
<li>This value is known as <strong>Q-values</strong>.</li>
<li>The agent then selects the actions with the highest Q-value in each state to maximize its long-term reward.</li>
<li>The most commonly used algorithm for value-based reinforcement learning is <strong>Q-learning</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="policy-based-reinforcement-learning">Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this approach, the agent learns an optimal policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, without calculating the value function.</li>
<li>The policy is updated based on the rewards received by the agent, with the goal of maximizing the expected reward over time.</li>
<li>The most common algorithm used for policy-based reinforcement learning is the <strong>REINFORCE</strong> algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="model-based-reinforcement-learning_1">Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this approach, the agent learns a model of the environment, which it can use to simulate different scenarios and plan its actions accordingly.</li>
<li>The model can learn through supervised or unsupervised learning, and the agent can use it to predict the outcome of its actions before taking them.</li>
<li>The most common model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is the <strong>Dyna</strong> algorithm.</li>
</ul>
